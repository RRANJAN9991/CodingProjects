## Work Experience
**Financial Data Analyst @ UniversaCare (_December 2022 - July 2023_)**
-	Cleaned and analyzed large insurance billing datasets in Python and Excel and as a result was able to collect over 75,000 dollars of owed payment from health insurances that was initially marked as bad debt. 
-	Presented to our insurance contracts the visualizations generated from my analysis and was able to establish new rules on payment to prevent untimely payments. 
-	Completed extensive python programs that automated processes for different departments to save them 100s of tedious work hours. 

**Data Analyst Graduate Intern @ UniversaCare (_August 2022 - December 2022_)**
-	Conducted in-depth analysis of insurance data to visualize the distribution of home health aide authorization hours among patients, assessing the utilization levels to ensure optimal use of resources.
-	Was able to identify patients not utilizing their full authorization and have them contacted resulting in 1000s of dollars of increased weekly revenue.

**Tutor @ Eye Level (_January 2019 - January 2023_)**
-	Helped over 100 students ranging from elementary to college level educational background achieve higher scores on their exams, homework, projects, etc.
-	Assisted students during the pandemic virtually through Zoom with their assignments. 


## Graduate Student Projects
### Predicting Parental Education Levels Using Bayesian Networks: A Data-Driven Approach
[Project Content](/Python Projects/BayesianNetwork_Implementation.zip)

In this project, a Bayesian Network was developed to predict parental levels of education based on various factors using the pgmpy library. The dataset included features such as race/ethnicity, lunch type, test preparation course completion, and scores in math, reading, and writing. The Bayesian Network structure was defined to model the probabilistic relationships between these features and parental education levels. Data preprocessing involved label encoding for categorical features and discretization of continuous scores. The Bayesian Network was trained on the dataset using the fit method, and inference was performed using the VariableElimination class. The model's inputs included scores and categorical features, with the output being a prediction for parental education levels.

The model demonstrated the power of Bayesian Networks in capturing complex dependencies and making predictions based on available data. By incorporating a holistic set of factors, including student scores and demographic information, the model provided valuable insights into educational outcomes. This project highlighted the importance of accurate representation of dependencies and the need for adaptability to changing societal norms for practical development and use of Bayesian Networks in educational decision-making.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
