## Work Experience
**Financial Data Analyst @ UniversaCare (_December 2022 - July 2023_)**
-	Cleaned and analyzed large insurance billing datasets in Python and Excel and as a result was able to collect over 75,000 dollars of owed payment from health insurances that was initially marked as bad debt. 
-	Presented to our insurance contracts the visualizations generated from my analysis and was able to establish new rules on payment to prevent untimely payments. 
-	Completed extensive python programs that automated processes for different departments to save them 100s of tedious work hours. 

**Data Analyst Graduate Intern @ UniversaCare (_August 2022 - December 2022_)**
-	Conducted in-depth analysis of insurance data to visualize the distribution of home health aide authorization hours among patients, assessing the utilization levels to ensure optimal use of resources.
-	Was able to identify patients not utilizing their full authorization and have them contacted resulting in 1000s of dollars of increased weekly revenue.

**Tutor @ Eye Level (_January 2019 - January 2023_)**
-	Helped over 100 students ranging from elementary to college level educational background achieve higher scores on their exams, homework, projects, etc.
-	Assisted students during the pandemic virtually through Zoom with their assignments.

## Leadership Experience
**Stony Brook University – Teaching Assistant, Data Analysis Course and Graph Theory Course	(_January 2021 – May 2021_)**
-	Helped undergraduate students with their assignments, projects, and test preparation. 
-	Answering any questions they had in my weekly office hour meetings and for both courses, the overall student GPA for these courses were the highest compared to the past few years.

**UniversaCare – Financial Data Analyst (_March 2023 – July 2023_)**
-	Supervised and mentored two tech interns, assigning them hands-on tasks from my projects, and providing guidance to enhance their skills and contribute effectively to the team.

## Graduate Student Projects
### Data Warehouse Project: Analyzing NYC Weather and Accident Data
[Project Content](/Ranjan_CS689_DataWarehousingProject.zip)

I constructed a data warehouse for NYC weather and accident data. Using SQL analytical queries and Tableau visualizations, I answered various business questions, including identifying the safest types of vehicles to drive in different rain levels. The project also involved using the pysopg2 library in Python for ETL processes and maintaining the ETL in SQL. Overall, the project showcased my ability to manage complex data pipelines, analyze data effectively, and present insights visually.


### Predicting Parental Education Levels Using Bayesian Networks: A Data-Driven Approach
[Project Content](/Python Projects/BayesianNetwork_Implementation.zip)

In this project, a Bayesian Network was developed to predict parental levels of education based on various factors using the pgmpy library. The dataset included features such as race/ethnicity, lunch type, test preparation course completion, and scores in math, reading, and writing. The Bayesian Network structure was defined to model the probabilistic relationships between these features and parental education levels. Data preprocessing involved label encoding for categorical features and discretization of continuous scores. The Bayesian Network was trained on the dataset using the fit method, and inference was performed using the VariableElimination class. The model's inputs included scores and categorical features, with the output being a prediction for parental education levels.

The model demonstrated the power of Bayesian Networks in capturing complex dependencies and making predictions based on available data. By incorporating a holistic set of factors, including student scores and demographic information, the model provided valuable insights into educational outcomes. This project highlighted the importance of accurate representation of dependencies and the need for adaptability to changing societal norms for practical development and use of Bayesian Networks in educational decision-making.


### Deciphering NBA Player Positions: A Machine Learning Approach
[Project Content](/RahulRanjan_FinalProjectPart3_CS677 (2).zip)

In this project, the goal was to predict NBA player positions using machine learning models. The dataset was cleaned to address challenges like multiple entries for traded players, ensuring each player was represented once. Feature selection focused on key basketball statistics like scoring, efficiency, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, and fouls. Various machine learning models were trained and tested, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The Random Forest Classifier emerged as the best-performing model, achieving high accuracy across different player positions.

The analysis highlighted the importance of features like assists, defensive rebounds, blocks, offensive rebounds, and shooting percentages in predicting player positions. These features align with traditional basketball roles despite the modern NBA's evolution. The study also identified limitations, such as relying solely on statistics from the previous season and the dataset partitioning strategy. Addressing these limitations, such as incorporating historical data and exploring alternative dataset partitioning strategies, could improve the model's predictive accuracy and robustness.
