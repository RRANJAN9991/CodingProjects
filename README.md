## Work Experience
**Financial Data Analyst @ UniversaCare (_December 2022 - July 2023_)**
-	Cleaned and analyzed large insurance billing datasets in Python and Excel and as a result was able to collect over 75,000 dollars of owed payment from health insurances that was initially marked as bad debt. 
-	Presented to our insurance contracts the visualizations generated from my analysis and was able to establish new rules on payment to prevent untimely payments. 
-	Completed extensive python programs that automated processes for different departments to save them 100s of tedious work hours. 


**Data Analyst Graduate Intern @ UniversaCare (_August 2022 - December 2022_)**
-	Conducted in-depth analysis of insurance data to visualize the distribution of home health aide authorization hours among patients, assessing the utilization levels to ensure optimal use of resources.
-	Was able to identify patients not utilizing their full authorization and have them contacted resulting in 1000s of dollars of increased weekly revenue.

**Tutor @ Eye Level (_January 2019 - January 2023_)**
-	Helped over 100 students ranging from elementary to college level educational background achieve higher scores on their exams, homework, projects, etc.
-	Assisted students during the pandemic virtually through Zoom with their assignments. 


## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
